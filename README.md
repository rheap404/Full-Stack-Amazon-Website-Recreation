Welcome to the Full Stack Amazon Website Recreation project! This project aims to recreate the functionality and user experience of the popular e-commerce platform, Amazon, using a full stack web development approach. By following this guide, you will be able to set up and run the project on your local machine.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Features

User registration and authentication
Product browsing and searching
Shopping cart functionality
Checkout and payment processing
Order tracking and history
Product reviews and ratings

## Available Scripts

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
